Spent 3 days here at a nice camp site with good access to the bike trails. Split my time between working, running, biking, and watching movies once the sun went down. I got my fill of movies in, watching The Apartment, The Thing, and finishing the Lonesome Dove series. The only downside was that as a novice vanlifer, I chose a camping spot in the shade. This meant our battery system didn't recharge and I lost power on the night of my stay. From Maya's perspective, the downsides were that A) Helen wasn't there (tear emoji) and B) I took her on either a big bike ride or run every day (exercising is hard).",

      "summary": "On our way out of Vegas, we stopped outside Boulder City for a few nights. The first night, we were camped 'on' Lake Mead at the Boulder City Beach campground. You might think that because the campsite was called the Boulder City BEACH Campground that the sites would be right on the water's edge, but you would be wrong. For that to be true, my guess is that you would have to find a time machine and set the year to 2000, which is the last time Lake Mead was at full capacity. Since then, <a href='https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/lakemead_line.pdf' target='_blank'> the water levels have fallen almost 200 feet</a>. All that is to say, rather than being camped on the beach, Helen and I had to walk 20 minutes to dip our toes in the water. After our walk to the water, we rode the mountain bike trails at Bootleg Canyon just outside of town. To say the least, these trails were puckering. Never before have I been on a blue graded mountain bike trail and thought I had a greater than 50% chance of breaking my leg. To recover from the trauma, we each treated ourselves to fries, shakes and massive cheeseburgers at Chilly Jilly's. As we were leaving town, we stopped at the Hoover Dam, the scale of which we both found very impressive. After a night camped (more or less) on the side of the highway, we took a visit to Arizona Host Springs. The setting of the springs were in a slot canyon, and made for a very unique and beautiful setting. The only issue was that we had Maya with us. For the first 50 feet of the springs, the entire width of the slot canyon was filled with water well over 110 degrees (Fahrenheit), meaning I would have to carry Maya to cooler water if we wanted to soak. This wouldn't have been an issue if there wasn't a rickety, dead vertical, 20 foot ladder right where the hot water ended. Despite her many talents, Maya is not able to climb ladders. So, instead of soaking, we hiked out and went to a beach on the Colorado River down the road, where we both took a dip and Maya got to fetch sticks in the water to her heart's content.",

We added a little step that covered the the heater duct, a fold out table at the end of our counter, a windowsill that covered a number of miscellaneous cables. We also updated our propane system so that it supplied propane to both our stove and our water heater, and used a solenoid to control the flow of gas. This ended up being a more involved process that expected and featured many trips to Ace Hardware and a number of expletives (but no tears, which was a fun surprise).",
